# 🤖 LLM06 — Cloud AI Orchestrator

### 🔍 Overview
**LLM06** is a cloud AI security layer that protects **LLMs and chatbots** from data leaks, model inversion, and sensitive info exposure.  
It acts as a **firewall** between the user and the AI — scanning every request and response for risks.

## ⚡ Key Protections
- 🧠 **Model Inversion Defense** – Stops attempts to recover training data.  
- 🔒 **Data Leak Prevention** – Blocks or redacts personal info.  
- 🧩 **Membership Inference Guard** – Denies “Was X in your data?” queries.  
- 🪤 **Honeytoken Detection** – Alerts if fake data appears in outputs.  
- 🚨 **Alert System** – Logs incidents and notifies admins automatically.  
- 🔁 **Auto Remediation** – Quarantines and retrains affected models.

## 🔄 Workflow
| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| 🟩 **Input** | Scans prompts for risky requests |
| 🟦 **Processing** | Detects data probing or inversion |
| 🟨 **Output** | Cleans and redacts private info |
| 🟥 **Post** | Logs and alerts on incidents |

## 🚨 Response Actions
| Threat | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Model Inversion | Block & quarantine |
| Data Leak | Redact & alert |
| Canary Trigger | Stop service & revoke keys |
| Membership Query | Deny & rate-limit |

## 🧱 Outputs
- `guardrails.json` – detection rules  
- `detector.py` – runtime scanner  
- `incident_playbook.json` – response guide  
- `test_suite.json` – validation toolkit  

## 📊 Metrics
- Detection accuracy  
- Data leaks blocked  
- False positive rate  
- Response latency  

## 🧾 Compliance
GDPR • ISO 27001 • HIPAA • CERT-In • SOC 2  

## ✅ Result
LLM06 keeps your AI:
✔ Secure from inversion & leaks  
✔ Monitored in real time  
✔ Auto-repaired & compliant
