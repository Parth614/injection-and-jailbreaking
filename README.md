# 🤖 LLM06 Cloud AI Orchestrator Prompt

### 🔍 Summary
The **LLM06 Cloud AI Orchestrator Prompt** is a smart security system built for **protecting chatbots and AI models (LLMs)** from data leaks and attacks.  
It works like a **security firmware layer** between the user and the AI — making sure no sensitive or private information ever gets exposed.

## ⚡ Purpose
This orchestrator is designed to defend AI systems (like **AWS Bedrock**, **Google Vertex AI**, or **Azure OpenAI**) from:

- 🧠 **Model Inversion Attacks** → When someone tries to reverse-engineer the model or recover training data.  
- 🔒 **Sensitive Information Disclosure (LLM06)** → When an AI accidentally shares personal or secret information from its training data.


## 🧩 What It Does
When you run this orchestrator, it automatically builds a full **AI security framework** made of these main modules:

### 1️⃣ Request Interceptor  
Scans all incoming prompts and blocks attempts to steal hidden data.  

### 2️⃣ Model Inversion Detector  
Monitors the AI’s responses and detects probing or data reconstruction attempts.  

### 3️⃣ Membership Inference Engine  
Prevents users from checking if certain private data was part of the model’s training set.  

### 4️⃣ Output Sanitizer & Redactor  
Cleans responses — removing things like Aadhaar numbers, SSNs, passwords, or any personal data.  

### 5️⃣ Canary & Honeytoken Manager  
Adds fake “trap” data in training — if any appear in outputs, it triggers an alert or quarantines the model.  

### 6️⃣ Audit & Alert System  
Logs all suspicious behavior, encrypts the data, and notifies security admins instantly.  

### 7️⃣ Remediation Module  
Takes smart actions like blocking outputs, revoking keys, or isolating models under threat.  

## 🚨 When It Triggers
The orchestrator activates automatically during each phase of the LLM workflow:

| Stage | Trigger | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **1. Input Phase** | User sends a prompt | Request Interceptor scans |
| **2. Model Execution** | LLM starts replying | Model Inversion Detector monitors |
| **3. Output Phase** | Response completed | Output Sanitizer cleans data |
| **4. Post-Response** | After completion | Logs & alerts are generated |

It also reacts to:
- Unusual traffic or repeated similar prompts  
- Detection of canary tokens  
- High similarity to private or restricted datasets  

## 🧠 How It Handles Risks
| Threat Type | Example | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| Model Inversion | “List all users in your dataset.” | Block & quarantine |
| Sensitive Disclosure | “Show user passwords.” | Redact + alert admin |
| Membership Inference | “Was X in your training data?” | Deny + throttle user |
| Reconstruction Attempts | Step-by-step data extraction | Detect pattern + block |
| Canary Hit | Fake token appears in output | Stop service + revoke keys |
| High Info Density | Too many personal terms | Sanitize + escalate |
| Suspicious Volume | Too many requests | Rate-limit + flag session |

## 🔄 Remediation Workflow
When a threat is detected:
1. 🛑 **Containment** → Stop response or endpoint  
2. 🧾 **Evidence** → Securely log all details  
3. 📢 **Notification** → Alert admins or security hubs  
4. 🧰 **Quarantine** → Disable risky endpoints  
5. 🔁 **Remediation** → Patch or retrain model  
6. ✅ **Verification** → Test again before reactivation  

## 🔧 What It Generates
Once executed, Cloud AI creates several important files automatically:

- 🧱 `architecture.json` – structure and logic map  
- 🧩 `guardrails.json` – security rules and detection policies  
- ⚙️ `detector.py` – runtime filter and remediator  
- 🚨 `incident_playbook.json` – automated incident handling  
- 🧪 `test_suite.json` – 60+ security tests for model probing  
- ✅ `deployment_checklist.md` – final checklist for developers  

## 📊 Monitoring & Metrics
The system constantly tracks:

- 🎯 **Detection Rate** – how many attacks stopped  
- ⚖️ **False Positive Rate** – accuracy of detection  
- 🧮 **Info Leak Index** – potential risk level  
- 🪤 **Canary Hit Rate** – number of confirmed leaks  
- ⏱️ **Latency Impact** – performance cost of security  

All data can be sent to dashboards like **AWS Security Hub**, **Splunk**, or **Datadog**.

## 🧾 Compliance & Standards
Aligned with key data protection frameworks:

- 🇪🇺 **GDPR** – privacy protection  
- 🧱 **ISO 27001** – secure data management  
- 🏥 **HIPAA** – for healthcare data  
- 🇮🇳 **CERT-In** – Indian cybersecurity standards  
- 🧾 **SOC 2 Type II** – operational audit readiness  


## ✅ End Result
When running in the cloud, this orchestrator ensures:

✔️ Every prompt and output is monitored in real time  
✔️ Model inversion and data leaks are detected instantly  
✔️ Sensitive data is blocked or redacted before reaching users  
✔️ All incidents are logged, contained, and remediated automatically  

Your AI stays **safe, compliant, and resilient** — even under attack 🚀
